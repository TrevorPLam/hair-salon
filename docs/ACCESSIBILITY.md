- [ ] Note any elements that are not keyboard accessible
- [ ] Record tab order issues (e.g., focus jumps unexpectedly)
- [ ] Note any missing focus indicators

### After Testing
- [ ] Record findings in "Issues Found" section below
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks for any blocking a11y issues
- [ ] Update this document with test results

---

## 🐛 Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Block Launch)
*Document any issues that make the site unusable via keyboard*

**None found** *(update after testing)*

---

### Medium Priority (Fix Post-Launch)
*Document any issues that degrade experience but don't block usage*

**None found** *(update after testing)*

---

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)
*Document any minor improvements*

## Notes

- This is a **basic accessibility validation** focused on keyboard navigation
- For comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, additional testing required (screen readers, color contrast, ARIA labels, etc.)
- See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for full testing approach
- Current implementation includes:
  - `aria-expanded` on mobile menu button
  - `aria-label` on mobile menu container
  - Escape key handler for mobile menu
  - Focus management in dialogs (search)
