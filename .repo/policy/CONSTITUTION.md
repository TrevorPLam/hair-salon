# Repository Constitution

**File**: `.repo/policy/CONSTITUTION.md`

> **IMMUTABLE**: This file is immutable unless the solo founder explicitly approves changes.

> **Operating Principles**: See `.repo/policy/PRINCIPLES.md` for detailed operating principles that implement these constitutional articles.
> **Quality Gates**: See `.repo/policy/QUALITY_GATES.md` for merge rules and verification requirements.
> **Security**: See `.repo/policy/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for security rules and HITL triggers.
> **HITL**: See `.repo/policy/HITL.md` for Human-In-The-Loop process and item management.
> **Boundaries**: See `.repo/policy/BOUNDARIES.md` for module boundary enforcement.

## Article 1: Final Authority
The solo founder is the final authority for any ambiguity, conflict, or decision.

## Article 2: Verifiable over Persuasive
Work is not "done" without verification evidence. Proof beats persuasion.

## Article 3: No Guessing
If something is not explicitly known from repo docs, manifest, or code:
- Mark it as **UNKNOWN**
- Route to HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) or explicit questions
- Do not proceed on that uncertain portion

## Article 4: Incremental Delivery
Ship small, reviewable, testable increments.
Large tasks must be decomposed into smaller tasks. No mega-PRs without explicit approval.

## Article 5: Strict Traceability
Every meaningful change must be traceable to an explicit task definition and include verification proof.
Completed tasks must be archived to preserve a compact history of what changed, why, and how it was verified.

## Article 6: Safety Before Speed
If a change could break logins, money flows, user data, privacy, security, external services, or production behavior:
**SAFETY WINS.**
For risky/uncertain changes: **STOP → ASK (HITL) → VERIFY → THEN PROCEED.**

## Article 7: Per-Repo Variation Allowed
Governance structure is consistent, but per-repo workflow/execution may vary via manifest, packs, and repo checks.

## Article 8: HITL for External Systems
Anything involving credentials, vendor dashboards, production systems, billing, legal/compliance, or irreversible changes is HITL-gated.
