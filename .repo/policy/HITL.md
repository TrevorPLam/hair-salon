# Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)

**File**: `.repo/policy/HITL.md`

HITL = Human-In-The-Loop. This is the single binding place for human-required actions.

> **Related**: See `.repo/policy/CONSTITUTION.md` Article 3 (No Guessing), Article 6 (Safety Before Speed), Article 8 (HITL for External Systems), `.repo/policy/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for security triggers, and `.repo/policy/QUALITY_GATES.md` for merge blocking rules.

## Storage model
Split, same folder:
- Index (this file): `.repo/policy/HITL.md`
- Items: `.repo/hitl/HITL-XXXX.md`

## Rule: minimal human effort
The human does the smallest action possible (usually: set Status + add Evidence line).
Agents do all mechanical work: syncing PR body, archiving, and governance-verify reruns.

## Categories
- External Integration
- Clarification
- Risk
- Feedback
- Vendor

## Statuses
Pending | In Progress | Blocked | Completed | Superseded

## Merge blocking rule
If a PR has any required HITL item not in Completed status (or not validly waived), merge is blocked (see `.repo/policy/QUALITY_GATES.md` hard gates).

## Who can do what
- Agents may create HITL items and propose wording.
- Only the human may mark HITL items Completed.
- Agents must auto-sync HITL status changes into PR body and archive when completed.

## External systems detection (how to trigger HITL)
Detection is keywords + manifest + change type:
- If the change type implies external systems (security, release, schema), HITL is required.
- If the manifest command involves external credentials/dashboards, HITL is required.
- If keywords appear (credentials, token, billing, app store, vendor dashboard, prod deploy, payment, oauth), HITL is required.

See `.repo/policy/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for security review triggers that require HITL.
