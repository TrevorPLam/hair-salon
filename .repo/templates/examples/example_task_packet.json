    "POST /api/auth/refresh accepts refresh token and returns new access token",
    "JWT tokens expire after 15 minutes (access) and 7 days (refresh)",
    "All endpoints require authentication via JWT in Authorization header",
    "Test coverage >= 80% for auth module",
    "OpenAPI schema updated with new endpoints"

  "approach": "Use djangorestframework-simplejwt library. Create auth views, serializers, and URL routing. Add JWT authentication class to DRF settings. Write comprehensive tests.",
