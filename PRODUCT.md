# Product Vision: Your Dedicated Marketer

## Vision
Your Dedicated Marketer exists to give service-based firms a trusted, enterprise-grade marketing web presence that converts visitors into qualified leads with minimal operational overhead. The product pairs high-performance marketing pages with a governance-first workflow so teams can ship confidently without sacrificing security or quality.

## Mission
Deliver a marketing platform that is:
- **Conversion-focused**: fast, accessible pages and clear calls to action that drive inquiries.
- **Operationally reliable**: strict quality gates, traceability, and security checks baked into the workflow.
- **Easy to evolve**: modular architecture and reusable components that let teams scale content and features quickly.

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Service firms (consultancies, agencies, professional services) that need a modern marketing site and dependable lead capture.
- **Secondary:** Marketing and growth teams that require rapid iteration with governance guardrails.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Enterprise-grade marketing presence** with best-in-class performance and accessibility.
- **Secure lead capture** with validated forms, rate limiting, and compliance-friendly workflows.
- **AI-native governance** that supports safe, auditable changes without slowing delivery.

## Key Features & Business Value
- **Service pages** that support SEO and differentiated positioning.
- **Blog system** for thought leadership and organic traffic growth.
- **Validated contact forms** with rate limiting to protect inbound pipelines.
- **SEO automation** (sitemap, robots, Open Graph) for discoverability.
- **Governance tooling** (HITL, traceability, quality gates) to keep changes safe and compliant.

## Product Principles
- **Performance is a feature**: optimize for speed, Core Web Vitals, and accessibility.
- **Security by default**: protect data, avoid regressions, and maintain strict secret handling.
- **Clarity over complexity**: prefer simple flows and consistent, reusable patterns.
- **Measured iteration**: ship small, verify, and document decisions.

## Roadmap Priorities
1. **Security posture improvements** (dependency audits, SAST tooling, SBOM).
2. **Testing depth** (coverage improvements, visual regression testing).
3. **Operational automation** (release workflows, deployment automation).
4. **Performance monitoring** (instrumentation and dashboarding).

## Success Metrics
- Lead conversion rate and contact form completion.
- Lighthouse performance and accessibility scores.
- Reduced time-to-publish for new marketing content.
- Change failure rate (quality gate and rollback metrics).

## Non-Goals
- Building a general-purpose CRM or marketing automation platform.
- Supporting unmanaged third-party plugin ecosystems.
- Introducing runtime dependencies that reduce performance without clear ROI.
