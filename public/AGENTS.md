# public/AGENTS.md — Static Assets

Last Updated: 2026-01-21
Applies To: Any agent working in public/

**Quick Reference:** See `/BESTPR.md` for comprehensive repo standards.

## Purpose
This folder contains static assets that are served directly to the browser without processing. All files are publicly accessible at runtime.

## Structure

```
public/
├── AGENTS.md           # This file
├── images/             # Images, logos, icons
├── manifest.json       # PWA manifest
├── robots.txt          # Generated by app/robots.ts
└── sitemap.xml         # Generated by app/sitemap.ts
```

## Asset Guidelines

### Images
- **Format:** WebP preferred for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, SVG for logos/icons
- **Naming:** `kebab-case-description.ext` (e.g., `hero-image.webp`)
- **Optimization:** Compress before committing (use tools like `squoosh.app` or `tinypng.com`)
- **Alt text:** Document in code where used (not in filename)

### PWA Assets
- **manifest.json:** PWA configuration (app name, icons, theme)
- **Icons:** Multiple sizes required (192x192, 512x512 minimum)
- **Don't edit manually:** Use PWA manifest generator tools

### Generated Files
- **robots.txt:** Generated by `app/robots.ts` at build time
- **sitemap.xml:** Generated by `app/sitemap.ts` at build time
- **Don't commit:** These files are build artifacts

---

## Adding New Assets

1. **Optimize:** Compress images before committing
2. **Place:** In appropriate subfolder (or root for special files like manifest)
3. **Reference:** Use `/path-from-public` in code (e.g., `<img src="/images/logo.svg" />`)
4. **Document:** If non-obvious, add comment in code explaining purpose

---

## Security Notes

- **No secrets:** Never place API keys, tokens, or credentials here
- **Public access:** Everything here is directly accessible via HTTP
- **Sanitize SVGs:** Check for embedded scripts before committing
- **CORS:** All assets are served with CORS headers (public access)

---

## Don't

- ❌ Store environment-specific configs
- ❌ Place build artifacts (generated at build time)
- ❌ Commit unoptimized images (bloats repo size)
- ❌ Use spaces in filenames (breaks some tools)
